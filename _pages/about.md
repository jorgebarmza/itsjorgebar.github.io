Hello there 👋 I'm Jorge <span style="color:grey">(pronounced HOR-heh)</span> 

I work at <a href='https://labs.google/'>Google Labs</a>, building new AI tools for creators. I'm a full&#8209;stack engineer 👨🏻‍💻 with a deep interest in large&#8209;scale ML systems. My favorite thing in the world is collaborating to build products that bring people joy.

For recreation, I run trails, study math, share stories with friends, and appreciate each breath 🔸 I’m inspired by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism'>effective altruism</a> and give what I can toward a brighter future. 

You can reach me via email or social media: `@jorgebarmza`
