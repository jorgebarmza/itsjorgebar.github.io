Hello there 👋 I'm Jorge <span style="color:grey">(pronounced HOR-heh)</span> 

I work at <a href='https://labs.google/'>Google Labs</a>, building new AI tools for creators. I'm a full&#8209;stack engineer, fascinated by large&#8209;scale ML systems 🤖 My favorite activity is collaborating to solve meaningful technical problems.

For recreation, I run trails, study math, share stories with friends, and appreciate each breath 🌱 I’m a member of <a href='https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/'>Giving What We Can</a>, motivated to help improve the world.
