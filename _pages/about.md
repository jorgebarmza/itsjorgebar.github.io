Hello there 👋 I'm Jorge <span style="color:grey">(pronounced HOR-heh)</span> 

I work at <a href='https://labs.google/'>Google Labs</a>, building new GenAI tools for creators. I'm a generalist SWE 👨🏻‍💻 with a deep interest in large-scale ML systems. My favorite thing in the world is collaborating to build products that bring people joy.

For recreation 🏕️ I run trails, study math, share stories with friends, and appreciate each breath.

You can reach me via email or social media (`@jorgebarmza`)
